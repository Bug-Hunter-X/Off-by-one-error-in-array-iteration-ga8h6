This repository contains a simple Java program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error. The program attempts to iterate over an array using a for loop, but the loop condition is incorrect, leading to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. A solution is provided that corrects the loop condition to prevent the error.
